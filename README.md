# obsidian-serendipity-plugin

### Description
Serendipity plugin was born out of my need to revisit my past notes. It might invoke nostalgia by surfacing old journal entries, allowing you to reflect on your past thoughts and experiences, or a way to trigger interesting ideas and insights from on your past learnings, whether from books, articles, or personal observations.

In short, it helps force serendipitous discoveries by displaying random notes from your vault each time you open Obsidian. It's your personal time machine, and idea generator, rolled into one.

### Features
- Displays a random note from our vault in a modal when Obsidian is opened
- Customizable settings to specify a directory to pick a random note from
